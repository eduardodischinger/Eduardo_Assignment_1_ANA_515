We have data about `r nrow(gundeaths)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(gundeaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE} 
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(age)) + 
geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```

```{r race-dist, echo = FALSE} 
youth %>% 
ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(race) %>% fct_rev())) + 
geom_bar() + coord_flip() + 
labs(x = "Victim race")
```
